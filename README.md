# Towards Safe Autonomous Driving: Model Checking a Behavior Planner during Development

This is the repository we plan to use for the open source project for *Model Checking of C++ production code* as described in the TACAS24 paper (cf. https://zenodo.org/records/10556538). We will make all the sources of the toolchain public which we have so far published in binary format only, see here: https://zenodo.org/records/10013662.
